#===========================
# Install Intel OneAPI directly
# on the system instead of with
# Spack. This is because we need
# v2024.2.0 due to seg fault errors
# in the previous versions.
#
# https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/Internal-compiler-error-segmentation-violation-signal-raised/td-p/1590217
#
# and the version of Spack currently
# supported by spackstack 1.8.0 is limited
# to Intel OneAPI v2024.1.0.
#
# This script is based on the instructions at:

# Install - everything goes to /opt/intel/oneapi/

# To put it on your path, source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
sudo yum -y install intel-hpckit

# In mid 2024, the above installs only mpiifx. mpiifort is
# automatically replaced with mpifx. If you really do want
# ifort as the backend compiler with Intel MPI (i.e. true
# mpiifort) then you need to install this extra package:
yum install -y --downloadonly --downloaddir=/opt/rpms intel-oneapi-mpi-devel
sudo yum install intel-oneapi-mpi-devel
